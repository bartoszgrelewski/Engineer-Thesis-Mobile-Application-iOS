# RoomPlan

Part of ARKit, RoomPlan is a Swift API (available for iOS 16) that utilizes the camera and LiDAR Scanner on iPhone and iPad to create a 3D floor plan of a room.

Using the data provided by the RoomPlan API, I demonstrate the ability to
* Re-categorize and visualize room object data
    * E.g., re-categorizing an object from "Storage" to "Table"
* Guide users when placing objects into the scene
    * Warn users about nearby electrical, or fire hazards
    * Guide users on optimal locations for objects
* Implement label info UI/UX transforming 3D labels -> 2D views
